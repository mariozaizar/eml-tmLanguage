## :warning:  Sublime Text users

ðŸ“¦ For a while, this email grammar was available for Sublime Text users under [EML (E-Mail)](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/EML%20(E-Mail)) package, but it was hard to maintain. As for now, the project has been split into two repositories:

* [eml-tmLanguage](https://github.com/mariozaizar/eml-tmLanguage) (this repository) uses the old **Text Mate** syntax.
* [email.sublime-syntax](https://github.com/mariozaizar/email.sublime-syntax) (new repository) uses the new **Sublime Text** syntax.

:warning: While this code still works on **Sublime Text**, the support of it from this repository is no longer maintained.
I strongly recommend switching to the new repository (or package) to get the latest updates. 

ðŸ¤ž I'm trying my best to keep (and probably rename) the [EML (E-Mail)](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/EML%20(E-Mail)) package so everyone can keep getting updates from the new repository. Thanks again for your downloads and support! :pray:
